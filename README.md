# Black Friday Sales Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **predicting customer purchases** during **Black Friday** using **Machine Learning** techniques. By analyzing past sales data, the model helps businesses optimize marketing strategies and inventory management.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing purchase trends.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Using algorithms like **Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost**.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Improving model accuracy.
- **Feature Importance Analysis:** Identifying key factors influencing customer purchases.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Machine Learning** (Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Random Forest, Linear Regression)
- **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/black-friday-sales-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd black-friday-sales-prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset
- The dataset includes customer demographics, product details, and purchase amounts.
- Ensure the dataset is in CSV format and preprocessed before training.

## Usage
1. **Train the Model**: Run the training script to train the machine learning model.
2. **Evaluate Performance**: Analyze accuracy, RMSE, and RÂ² score.
3. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to predict sales for new customers.

To train the model, run:
```sh
python train.py
```

## Results
- The model accurately predicts purchase amounts based on customer and product details.
- Feature importance analysis helps understand which factors drive purchases.

## Future Improvements
- Implement **Deep Learning models** for enhanced accuracy.
- Deploy as a **web app** for real-time Black Friday sales predictions.
- Integrate **real-time customer behavior tracking** for better forecasting.
